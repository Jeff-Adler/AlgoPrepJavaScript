//indexOf: returns index where value is found in an array. returns -1 if notfound
//for ... of
//for ... in 
//splice
//slice
//[...array]
//++var vs var++: prefix returns incremented value, postfix returns original value (so it preserves incremented variable)
//var z = x || y

//if (key in Obj), if (!(key in Obj)) //checks if the Obj has the key
//Safer version: myObj.hasOwnProperty(key)

//if (arr === []) DOES NOT DETECT EMPTY ARRAYS, because is strict equality, 
//not just identity operator
//you can use: if(arr.length === 0) or something of that sort
