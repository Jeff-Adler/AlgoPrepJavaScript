Pure Recursion Tips:

- For arrays, use methods liek slice, the spread operator, and concat, which make copies of arrays but don't mutate them
- Since strings are immutable, you will need to use methods like slice, substr, or substring to make copies of strings
- To make copies of objects, use Object.assign or the spread operator
