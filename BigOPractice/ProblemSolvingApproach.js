//Understand the Problem
    //Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    //What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    //What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    //Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (In other words, do I have info to solve the problem?)
    //How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

//Explore Concrete Examples
    //Simple examples
    //Complex examples
