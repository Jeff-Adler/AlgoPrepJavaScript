Selection Sort: like bubble sort, but places shorted value in the beginning of array, rather than largest at the end. Doesnt use swap. Swap works different: iterate through array from beginning, and once smallest value is found, swap it with first value (then second-largest with second value, etc.)

Time Complexity: O(n^2)

Selection Sort is basically a crappy algo, worse than even bubble sort. One POSSIBLE advantage: you make less swaps in selections sort, so it could save memory, but thats rarely a concern
