//Use arrays:
    //when you need order
    //Insertion
        //Pushing to end (push): O(1)
        //Pushing to beginning (unshift): O(n)
        //Remove from end (pop): O(1)
        //Removing from beginning (shift): O(n)
    //Removal
    //Searching: O(n)
    //Access: O(1)

//Array Methods:
    //push: O(1)
    //pop: O(1)
    //shift: O(n)
    //unshift: O(n)
    //concat: O(n) (reduced from O(n+N);where n equals is the size one of the arrays)
    //slice: O(n) 
    //splice: O(n)
    //sort: O(n * log(n))
    //forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc: O(n)
