Linear search on arrays: if list is unsorted, this is best option
Time Complexity: O(n) (best: O(1), worst: O(n), average: O(n))

- indexOf
- includes
- find
- findIndex

Binary search on sorted array: find entry at midpoint of SORTED array, if target is less than entry, take first half of array. if target is more than entry,
take second half of array. Repeat this recursively

- Divide and conquer!
- eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
- must be sorted
