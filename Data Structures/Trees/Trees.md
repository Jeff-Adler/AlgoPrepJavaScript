Trees:

- data structures that consists of nodes in Parent/Child relationship
  - produces branching structure
  - in plain tree, node can have 0 to infinity children

Trees vs. Lists:

- Lists: Linear
  - Singly-linked list (sort of) = special case of a tree, with one child per node
- Trees: Non-linear

Types of trees

- Plain Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees

Tree Rules:

- a node can only point to a child.
  - No multiple parents
  - No connected siblings

Terminology:

- Root: top node of a tree
- Child: node directly connected node moving away from root
- Parent: converse of child
- Siblings: group of nodes with same parent
- Leaf: node with no children
- Edge: connection between one node and another

Applications:

- HTML DOM
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Tree (model loops, conditionals, etc.)
- Modeling decision trees (such as in Games)
- Artificial Intelligence
- Directories/File Structures (Computer File Systems)
- Parsing JSON creates/traverses tree-like structure
