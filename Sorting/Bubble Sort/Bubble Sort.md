Bubble Sort:

- Not that efficient

- Not that common

- ONE good used case

- Compare first two values, swap if value 1 is higher than value 2. Continue swapping iteratively until highest value has 'bubbled' to the top. Then go back to the beginning until second highest value has 'bubbled' to the top, and so forth
